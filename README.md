# Fibre_Transfer_washing-activities

[![DOI](XXX.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/XXX)

This study investigates the impact of washing activities on both the release of fibres into wastewater and the transfer of constituent fibres from donor garments to receiver swatches. 
Using a low-cost friction tester and automated data collection through photography and ImageJ image processing software, controlled conditions were maintained for repeatable experiments.
This is the source code with the raw data for individual analysis, to recreate  the figures shown in the paper.
