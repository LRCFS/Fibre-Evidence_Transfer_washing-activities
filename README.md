# Exploring the influence of washing activities on the transfer and persistence of fibres in forensic science

This repository contains a series of R scripts designed for analysing the data from a study investigating the impact of washing activities on both the release of fibres into wastewater and the transfer of constituent fibres from donor garments to receiver swatches. 
Enclosed are the source code and raw data for individual analysis, facilitating the recreation of the figures depicted in the paper. The project is structured into four main parts:
- Data Upload: This script prepares and exports all necessary data for generating figures related to the article, including the donor garment weights, wastewater volume, fibre released in wastewater, and transferred fibres.
- Wastewater Volume and Fibre Release Analysis: This script generates figures visualising wastewater volume, the mass of fibres released, and the relationship between fibre mass and wastewater volume.
- Secondary Transfer Experiments Analysis: This script generates figures illustrating the secondary transfer of fibres from the washing machine to receiver garments.
- Transfer Experiments Analysis: This script produces figures from the transfer experiment with washing series versus the control garment, repetitive transfer, and the comparison between fibres released into wastewater versus those transferred to garments.
